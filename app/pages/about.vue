            Hi, I'm a full-stack developer with a deep passion for food, health, and creating tools that make life easier.
            MenuMate started as a personal project — a recipe management and meal planning app that I could rely on daily.
            I built this tool to take control of my nutrition, organize my cooking, and make everyday food decisions less stressful.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
            Packed with features like a recipe importer, macro tracker, food journal, and grocery list generator, MenuMate became the backbone of my routine.
            It helped me get back into shape, streamline my eating habits, and bring more order to my day-to-day.
